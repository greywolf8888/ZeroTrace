# Local Validation Record — 2026-08-09

This record captures the latest local acceptance run. It is evidence for the runnable foundation,
not a terminal-product or production-deployment approval.

## Environment

| Component      | Version / context                                  |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Host           | Windows, workspace path containing Unicode         |
| Node.js        | 24.11.1                                            |
| npm            | 11.6.2                                             |
| Docker Engine  | 29.2.1                                             |
| Docker Compose | 5.1.0                                              |
| Browser        | Playwright Chromium 151, desktop and Pixel 7 modes |

The validation stack used alternate host ports to avoid unrelated local services: API `18080`, web
`15173`, PostgreSQL `15432`, ClickHouse `18123`, Valkey `16379`, NATS `14222/18222`, and MinIO
`19000/19001`. Container-internal ports remain the documented defaults.

## Clean container and database result

- API, web, PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, Valkey, NATS, and MinIO reached running state;
- API, web, PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, and Valkey health checks reported healthy;
- the production-pruned API image measured `75,905,711` bytes and the web image measured
  `26,257,140` bytes in this Docker Engine;
- `vitest` and `pino-pretty` were absent from the API image; npm retained `typescript` as an optional
  peer in the pinned `viem`/`abitype` graph;
- PostgreSQL applied `001_core` and `002_indexes`, created the six representative core tables
  checked by the run, and installed four append-only triggers;
- ClickHouse created `raw_chain_facts`, `platform_events`, and `metric_series`; `CHECK TABLE` passed
  and `metric_series` retained its Known/value consistency constraint;
- a transactional mutation probe was rejected by PostgreSQL's Evidence trigger and rolled back with
  zero rows persisted;
- an `UNKNOWN` metric carrying a numeric value was rejected by ClickHouse with
  `VIOLATED_CONSTRAINT` and zero probe rows persisted;
- the web proxy returned API health, and the web response included CSP, frame denial, referrer, and
  content-type hardening headers.

Database initialization SQL is copied into dedicated image stages. This avoided a reproduced Docker
Desktop bind-mount stall caused by the Unicode workspace path.

## Public-chain smoke observations

The host network uses an interception proxy that maps public names to the reserved `198.18.0.0/15`
range. With the secure default `ALLOW_PRIVATE_PROVIDER_URLS=false`, ZeroTrace correctly returned
`PRIVATE_NETWORK_BLOCKED`. For this local smoke only, the explicit opt-in was enabled while the exact
hostname allowlist, HTTPS restriction, redirect denial, and read-only method allowlists remained in
force.

### Bitcoin mainnet

- provider: Blockstream Esplora;
- snapshot height: `961647`;
- block hash: `00000000000000000000c77603e60771be65dc27421aebff0b7a66edd29703d7`;
- subject: `bc1qw508d6qejxtdg4y5r3zarvary0c5xw7kv8f3t4`;
- normalized facts: confirmed balance `0` sats, mempool delta `0` sats, transaction count `166`;
- Evidence ID: `ev_bd75318d39376f50da863a0f`;
- consistency marker: `BEST_EFFORT_ESPLORA_TIP`.

The zero balances above are provider-returned Known values at the recorded snapshot, not a fallback
for unavailable data.

### Solana mainnet

- provider: official public Solana JSON-RPC;
- commitment: `finalized`;
- snapshot slot: `438084246`;
- blockhash: `7HuThTxhLV7dgzcqVL1iAQeaFqyuk259Mjf4AUyk1EL8`;
- subject: system program `11111111111111111111111111111111`;
- normalized facts: account exists, `1` lamport, executable, owner
  `NativeLoader1111111111111111111111111111111`;
- Evidence ID: `ev_6d7be195e513ed7b3d264a62`.

### Boundaries

- Ethereum and BNB Smart Chain remained `UNCONFIGURED`; no EVM live-read acceptance is claimed.
- The two observations are floating-head smoke checks. They are not immutable fixture suites, archive
  validation, independent provider reconciliation, reorg tests, or protocol-decoder acceptance.
- Evidence persistence is process-local, so the IDs above are reproducible content references but do
  not survive an API restart until the PostgreSQL repository is wired.

## Automated verification

| Command                  | Result                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `npm run verify`         | pass: format, lint, typecheck, 84 unit, 12 integration, build, licenses, audit |
| `npm run test:coverage`  | pass: 95.41% statements, 82% branches, 99.29% functions, 96.36% lines          |
| `npm run test:e2e`       | pass: 6 Chromium tests across desktop and Pixel 7                              |
| `npm run sbom`           | pass: CycloneDX JSON generated locally                                         |
| `docker compose config`  | pass                                                                           |
| production Compose smoke | pass with the port overrides documented above                                  |

Remote GitHub Actions, dedicated/provider-key EVM reads, archive history, load, failover, reorg,
backup/restore, and production security controls remain external acceptance gates.
